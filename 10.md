## Call stack

* Mechanism for an interpreter (browser / server) to keep track of its place when running code that calls multiple functions.

* Single threaded and syncronous

### How it operates

> Begin with empty call stack. When a function is invoked, its added. After it executed it's removed. End with empty call stack.

LIFO (Last in, first out)

1. Function called
2. Added to call stack and operate
3. Nested functions added further up
4. When function completes, removed from stack and resume last
5. If stack takes up more space than assigned -> "Stack Overflow" (recursion issue)


### Example

```js
function greeting() {
   // [1] Some codes here
   sayHi();
   // [2] Some codes here
}
function sayHi() {
   return "Hi!";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some codes here
```

Call stack

1. Reach `greeting()`
2. Add `greeting()` to call stack
    ```bash
    greeting
    ```
3. Execute `greeting()`
4. Reach `sayHi()` invocaton
5. Add `sayHi()` to call stack
    ```bash
    sayHi
    greeting
    ```
6. Execute `sayHi()`
7. Return to line that invoked `sayHi()` and compelete execution of `greeting()`
8. Delete `sayHi()` from call stack
    ```bash
    greeting
    ```
9. Return to line invoking `greeting()`
10. Delete `greeting()` from call stack
    ```bash
    EMPTY
    ```

## Types of errors

* Reference error
  * Using a vairable thats not declared
* Syntax error
  * cannot be parsed with given sytax (e.g. bad JSON)
* Range error
  * Access / manipulate beyond array range
* Type error
  * Undefined, incompatiable type

## Debugging

* Use `console.log()`
* Use dev tools in chrome
  * Use `debugger:` statement to see history
* VS Code debug
* Handle errors w/ `try...catch`
