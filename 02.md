# jQuery, Events, and The DOM

## JavaScript and jQuery

*Source: JavaScript and jQuery by Jon Duckett*

Simplies common JS tasks with full browser compatibility.

- Select elements
- Perform tasks
- Handle events

### Overview

#### Select elements

- `jQuery()`
- creates an object that holds reference to selected element
- One parameter: CSS selector
- `$('li.hot')` (More common shorthand)

#### Do something

- Use jQuery object methods
- `$('li.hot').addClass('complete');`

#### DOM Comparison

- Similiarities
  - Selectos perform tasks
  - Can store object in varaible, like DOM nodes
  - Can use methods/properties to manipulate DOM
- Differences
  - jQuery syntax simplier
  - Cross-browser, no need for fall back code
  - Event handling uses one method, works in all major browsers
  - Methods affect all selected, no need to loop
  - Methods for popular tasks like animation
  - Can apply multiple methods to selection

### Using jQuery

- include in script tag above `</body>`
- Get from [https://jquery.org](https://jquery.org)
- Minified version is smaller but not readible
  - `jquery-1.11.0.min.js`

```html
   <script src="js/jquery-1.11.0.js"></script>
   <script src="js/example.js"></script>
</body>
```

### Example

```javascript
$(':header').addClass('headline'); //selects all h1-h6 headings, adds headline class
$('li:lt(3)').hide().fadeIn(1500); //select first 3 list items. Hide them. Fade into view.
$('li').on('click', function(){ //set event listener on each list item. On click, remove it.
   $this.remove();
});
```

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

*Source: [https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)*

Pair programming is the practice of 2 developers working together. One will "drive": write the code; and one will "navigate": provide ideas and feedback.

1. Greater Efficiency
   - Slightly slower, but better code so it's faster long term.
2. Engaged collaboration
   - Increases focus (less likely to procrastinate/get off task)
   - Help avaliable, prevents blocks
3. Learning from fellow students
   - Learn new approaches to solving problems
   - Learn new skill sets
4. Social skills
   - Improves communication skill
   - Long term career benefit
5. Job interview readiness
   - Pair programming used in interviews
6. Work environment readiness
   - Many companies use pair programming
