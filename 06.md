# Node, Express, and APIs

[Source: An Introduction to Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

## What is Node.js

- Program to execute JavaScript outside of the browser.
- Built on V8 engine-- open source JS engine runs runs in Chromium based browsers.

## Installing Node.js

- Direct from node download page
- (Preferred) Using a version manager, NVM, so you can have multiple versions of Node at once.
- To check version install
  
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

- To run js file in node

  ```bash
  node hello.js
  ```

## Package Management w/ NPM

- Node is bundled with a package manager, NPM
- NPM is *the* JS package manger, and largest registry
- To check version install
  
  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```

### To install a package **globally**
  
  ```bash
  npm install -g jshint
  ```

### To install a package **locally**

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  npm install lodash --save
  ```

This process does 2 things:

- Creates a package.json file in the directory
  - Package.json file describes dependencies, allowing other devs to use NPM to install them
- Includes a node_modules folder with relevant files.
  - Don't include in version control.

  ```javascript
  const _ = require('lodash');
  ```

This specifies which packages are neded in a file

## Using Node.js

- Many uses: bundling files and dependencies, running tests, code linting, style checking

### Run JavaScript on the Server

The biggest use case for Node.js

- Node.js is single threaded and event driven
- Allows non-blocking processing of actions

#### **Example**

hello-world-server.js

```javascript
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end('Hello, World!');
}).listen(3000);

console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
```

```bash
node hello-world-server.js
```

Browser: http://localhost:3000

> Note: Use nodemon to autoreload server changes

### Disadvantages

- Since Node is single threaded, avoid blocking I/O calls.
- Hand off CPU-intensive operations to worker thread

### Advantages

- Speed / scalability
- Use same language for backend / frontend
- JSON (same syntax browser <-> server <-> client)

Use Node.js for...

- Real time interactions
- APIs
- Data streaming

### Other Uses

- Scripting
- Cross-platform desktop apps
