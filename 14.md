# Database Normalization

* Method to orgnize database tables and columns
* Each table is a specifi topic / purpose
* Reduces data duplication
* Minimize data modification issues
* Simplify queries

## Normal Forms

* 1st, 2nd, 3rd (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
* Forms are progressive, 2ND must satisfy 1NF rules, etc
* Other forms exist, like BCNF

1. First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

2. Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.

3. Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
