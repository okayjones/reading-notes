## The code I'm still ashamed of

This article discussed a project the author worked on with deceptive advertising. The point was to show that you have personal responsibility to the work you contribute to, regardless of your specific role. It doesn't matter if it wasn't your idea or project. It's your responsibility to vet a projects impact to ensure it won't cause harm. It's interesting to think about how to manage this in a work setting. Unforutnately the author doesn't describe what they wish they had done differently.

## Morality, ethics of a self-driving car: Who decides who lives, dies?

Article poses the question of how self-driving cars should respond in accidents. Given that cars are just technology and will need to be programmed to solve this-- how do you chose who's life to save? Even if this saves more lives from accidents compares to today, the difference is that we're deciding ahead of time who's life is valuable. Likely consumers won't want to purchase a car that should chose to sacrifice them. On the flip side, others won't feel comfortable on the road with cars that may chose to disregard their lives. The article didn't provide a solution, but it's interesting to think about how these kinds of ethically difficult questions will keep coming up as we try to automate our lives.
