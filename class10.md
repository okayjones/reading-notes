# Stacks and Queues

[Source: Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)

## Stacks

Stacks operate as LIFO (Last In First Out). All actions operate on the top of the queue.

1. `Push` - Add top top of stack
2. `Pop` - Remove from top of stack
3. `Top` - Top of the stack
4. `Peek` - Check the top value

## Queues

Queues operate as FIFO (First In First Out)

1. `Enqueue` - Add to back of the queue
2. `Dequeue` - Remove from front of the queue
3. `Front` - Beginning of queue
4. `Rear` - End of queue
5. `Peek` - Check the front value
